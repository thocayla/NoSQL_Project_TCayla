# NoSQL_Project_TCayla

The goal of this project is to provide the “best” place to live in New York City according to some  criteria such as a safe area, good services, means of transportations nearby, specific activities nearby, etc. 

All the datasets have been retrieved from here: https://nycopendata.socrata.com/.

All the codes have been computed on MongoDB.

These files are .js file format. 

They are ordered by ascending sequence from 1 to 14. 

You must start from the 1_…, 2_…, …, to the 14_… file in order to find the final output address.

PS: a shell script is also provided in order to import all the datasets in one time.
